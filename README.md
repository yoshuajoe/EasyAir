# EasyAir

EasyAir is a experimental project based on empirical research, that is focused in text mining and understanding the linguistic pattern generated by machine. Research's topics included:

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Version
3.1.1

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
